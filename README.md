# Binary Tree
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children: left and right. The top node is called the root.

##  Languages or Frameworks Used

The program was created with Python3.

##  Description

Implementation of a binary tree in python. 
It allows the creation, modification, and printing of a binary tree data structure.
There are 3 folder in File 
1) node.py - 
 In this python file defines a class Node, which represents nodes in a binary tree. 
  Attributes:
    left: Represents the left child of the node. Initialized to None.
    right: Represents the right child of the node. Initialized to None.
    data: Holds the data or value associated with the node.

2) tree.py
  This Python code defines a Tree class for representing a binary tree and includes various methods to manipulate and interact with the tree. 
    
 **Methods:**\
 _getRoot()_ - Return root of the binary tree\
 _add(data)_ - Add data's value onto the binary tree as a node\
 _find(data)_ - Find the node that contains data in the binary tree\
 _deleteTree()_ - Delete the binary tree\
 _printTree()_ - Prints all node values in the binary tree onto console

3) main.py
   Take input from user and print


## ðŸŒŸ How to run

`python ./main.py` to execute the code.
